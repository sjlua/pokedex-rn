# Pokédex RN
This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app), with React Native. I made this app to learn how React Native and Expo work.

All Pokémon names and references used belong to Nintendo and The Pokémon Company Inc. I do not claim ownership over any IP related to Pokémon.

## Future features
- [x] Light/dark mode support.
- [ ] Storing partner Pokemon locally to your device.
- [x] Add more statistics to the Statistics page (e.g., total weight, height, etc.).
- [ ] Add Moves to the Statistics page.
- [ ] Add logo.
- [ ] Code cleanup and refactoring.
- [ ] Checklist for storing Pokemon caught status.
- [ ] Onboarding flow which highlights core features.

## Credits
This app was based on [Code with Beto](https://youtu.be/BUXnASp_WyQ)'s tutorial.

## Get started
The following are the (mostly) standard instructions for an Expo project.
1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
